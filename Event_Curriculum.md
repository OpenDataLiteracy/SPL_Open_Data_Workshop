# Event Curriculum

Each event may have different curriculum needs based on audience, logistics, and goals. The structure of both of Seattle Public Library's _Up & Running with Open Data_ events had an introductory session, two breakout sessions, each with a beginner track and and intermediate track, as well as a final closing session. 

Some curriculum remained the same between the public and staff events. In Breakout Session 2, however, SPL tailored the staff event to contain curriculum tailored to that audience.
