# Preparation and Research

Before starting to formally plan the two _Up & Running with Open Data_ events, we started by surveying the landscape around Open Data efforts. We looked at work around data literacy, and Open data competencies as well as Open Data outcome metrics. More specifically, we reviewed:  
* Data literacy
* Data literacy & Open Data Curriculum 
* Goals and objectives
* Open Data outcome metrics & standards
