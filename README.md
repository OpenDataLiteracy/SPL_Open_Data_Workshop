# _Up & Running with Open Data: Two Seattle Public Library Events_

This repository follows the planning process for two Open Data workshops titled _Up & Running with Open Data_, put on in September, 2017. It serves as a toolkit for others looking to replicate or implement their own Open Data event in their community. 

On the landing page of the repository you will find:
* Preparation & Research 
* Process & Materials
* Event Curriculum 
* Resources & Supplemental Materials  
* ZIP file of all documents used in SPL's event planning process

Each of the above files has associated Git Wikis, which are linked to each markdown file. The Wikis provide more specific content and may contain links to actual planning documents and curriculum resources used for Seattle Public Library's Open Data events. You will find all of the linked files in this repository bundled in the zip file as well.
