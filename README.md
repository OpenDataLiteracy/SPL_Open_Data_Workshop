# _Up & Running with Open Data: Two Seattle Public Library Events_

This repository follows the planning process for two Open Data workshops titled _Up & Running with Open Data_, put on in September, 2017. It serves as a toolkit for others looking to replicate or implement their own Open Data event in their community. It details Seattle Public library's event planning process from start to finish, outlining a framework that can be adapted and reused.

It is important to note that the Seattle Public Library chose to name their event _Up & Running with Open Data_, employing a thematic approach to the Open Data events. While this approach may not work for all events, we found it to aptly articulate the aim of the events to the target audiences.

On the landing page of the repository you will find:
* Planning and Preparation 
* Planning Process & Materials
* Event Curriculum 
* Start Here:  Open Data Event Planning
* Resources and Supplemental Materials

Each of the above files has associated Git Wikis, which are linked to each markdown file. The Wikis provide more specific content and may contain links to actual planning documents and curriculum resources used for Seattle Public Library's Open Data events.
